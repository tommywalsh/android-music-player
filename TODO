Screen lock might be broken now due to permission changes?

Song provider is kinda a mess
 - hard-coded strings for sub modes, used both in displays and in program logic
 - band sequential always repeats first song
Needs a redesign which should support all known uses without weird special-case code
---
Customized back and forward presses, which can vary based on context
Back: to beginning of song, to previous song, to beginning of album, to beginning of full list
Forward: to next song, to next album

Data reported to bluetooth controller should come from MCotP, and should not use in-file MP3 tags!
---
- Maybe restore former song playtime after restart?
- Improve look and feel of library, perhaps by using buttons instead of labels?
---

---
Cleanup opportunities:
- Audit TODOs and "future directions"

---
- Allow "early access" to database before first scan complete?
- Better use of external media dirs (e.g. require mcotp to be under a "Music" directory?)
- Make sure library scrolls to correct screen location on navigation from player

How to deal with sorting multiple releases in the same year?
We will need this for band sequential mode to work 100% correctly


How to deal with band names not matching directory names (Anthrax, The Smiths, R.E.M.)?

DEFERRED Augment scanning code to handle "last updated" file info, so we can update DB as SD card changes
DEFERRED Playback behaves differently for:
    - DB uninitialized and idle
    - DB partially initialized, initialization underway
    - DB fully initialized and idle
    - DB fully initialized, being rescanned  (potentially same as initialized/idle)
