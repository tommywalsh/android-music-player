- Maybe restore former song playtime after restart?
- Improve look and feel of library, perhaps by using buttons instead of labels?
- UI will sometimes still show the wrong playstate. It's unclear how to reproduce this reliably.
- Can we move special permissions into build variant subdirectories (so normal app doesn't need to declare bluetooth and lock permissions)

IMPROVE BEHAVIOR AT INITIAL STARTUP!
  - Currently UI freezes as DB is scanned
  - Required steps to get this to work:
     1) If updating from an older app ID or database version, must delete old app
     2) Install, but do not run new app  (alternatively: run app, then force stop it, then clear its data)
     3) Allow all permissions on app
     4) Start app. It will not show anything useful.  Wait at least 3 minutes, or watch app log in Android Studio
     5) Restart app, or select a band from library view.
     6) App should work from now on.

Cleanup opportunities:
- Audit TODOs and "future directions"

---
- Allow "early access" to database before first scan complete?
- Better use of external media dirs (e.g. require mcotp to be under a "Music" directory?)
- Make sure library scrolls to correct screen location on navigation from player

How to deal with sorting multiple releases in the same year?
We will need this for band sequential mode to work 100% correctly


How to deal with band names not matching directory names (Anthrax, The Smiths, R.E.M.)?

DEFERRED Augment scanning code to handle "last updated" file info, so we can update DB as SD card changes
DEFERRED Playback behaves differently for:
    - DB uninitialized and idle
    - DB partially initialized, initialization underway
    - DB fully initialized and idle
    - DB fully initialized, being rescanned  (potentially same as initialized/idle)
