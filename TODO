DONE Make simple library browser in UI
DONE Import music scanning code (can do brute-force whole-library scan for now)
DONE Serve up scanned bands using library API, verify using UI
DONE Add database

6) Add full-library shuffle playback
---
7) Create custom player UI with better controls
8) Playback behaves differently for:
    - DB uninitialized and idle
    - DB partially initialized, initialization underway
    - DB fully initialized and idle
    - DB fully initialized, being rescanned  (potentially same as initialized/idle)
---
Cleanup opportunities:
- Add comments everywhere

---
Keep adding missing features like locking, playback modes, etc.
  - Allow "early access" to database before first scan complete?
  - Better use of external media dirs (e.g. require mcotp to be under a "Music" directory?

---
DEFERRED Augment scanning code to handle "last updated" file info, so we can update DB as SD card changes
