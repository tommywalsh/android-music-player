DONE Make simple library browser in UI
 DONE Make listview UI
 DONE Hook up top-level library to UI

2) Import music scanning code (can do brute-force whole-library scan for now)
3) Serve up scanned bands using library API, verify using UI
- Add "breadcrumbs" as user navigates down into bands, albums, etc.
---
4) Add database
5) Augment scanning code to handle "last updated" file info, so we can update DB as SD card changes
6) Add full-library shuffle playback
---
7) Create custom player UI with better controls
8) Playback behaves differently for:
    - DB uninitialized and idle
    - DB partially initialized, initialization underway
    - DB fully initialized and idle
    - DB fully initialized, being rescanned  (potentially same as initialized/idle)
---
Keep adding missing features like locking, playback modes, etc.
