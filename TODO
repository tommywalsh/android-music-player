- Maybe restore former song playtime after restart?

Cleanup opportunities:
- Audit TODOs and "future directions"
- Scanner needs to kick off automatically, without user needing to switch to the library UI!
- separate packages for UI and backend

---
- Allow "early access" to database before first scan complete?
- Better use of external media dirs (e.g. require mcotp to be under a "Music" directory?
- Make selection button stretch to side of screen in library mode
- Make sure library scrolls to correct screen location on navigation from player

How will we communicate non-standard info across app/service boundary, like double-shot weekend, and sequential mode, etc.?

How to deal with sorting multiple releases in the same year?
We will need this for band sequential mode


How to deal with band names not matching directory names (Anthrax, The Smiths, R.E.M.)?

Better scrolling through long list of bands

DEFERRED Augment scanning code to handle "last updated" file info, so we can update DB as SD card changes
DEFERRED Playback behaves differently for:
    - DB uninitialized and idle
    - DB partially initialized, initialization underway
    - DB fully initialized and idle
    - DB fully initialized, being rescanned  (potentially same as initialized/idle)

A second call to "connect" happens when bluetooth connects!
Actually any change to bluetooth seems to cause a new "accepting connection" method!

Do I need to make another connection every time start() is called, or may I continue to use old stuff?
