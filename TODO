DONE Make simple library browser in UI
 DONE Make listview UI
 DONE Hook up top-level library to UI

DONE Import music scanning code (can do brute-force whole-library scan for now)
 DONE Bands
 DONE Albums, album songs and loose songs

DONE Serve up scanned bands using library API, verify using UI
 DONE Add "breadcrumbs" as user navigates down into bands, albums, etc.\

4) Add database
   Allow "early access" to database before first scan complete?
5) Augment scanning code to handle "last updated" file info, so we can update DB as SD card changes
6) Add full-library shuffle playback
---
7) Create custom player UI with better controls
8) Playback behaves differently for:
    - DB uninitialized and idle
    - DB partially initialized, initialization underway
    - DB fully initialized and idle
    - DB fully initialized, being rescanned  (potentially same as initialized/idle)
---
Keep adding missing features like locking, playback modes, etc.
